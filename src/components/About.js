        <p>
          Iâ€™m Dushyanth Asrani Gopal, an M.S. student in Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics at the University of South Florida, passionate about leveraging data for impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          With over 3 years of experience at Accenture and Cognizant, Iâ€™ve built scalable Snowflake data warehouses, optimized SQL procedures, automated SAP BRF+ workflows, and developed Python-based ETL pipelines on AWS.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the U.S., Iâ€™ve contributed to connected vehicle research by designing real-time Tableau dashboards. Currently, at Tenet Healthcare, Iâ€™m working as a Data Engineer Intern, building scalable GCP pipelines using BigQuery, Airflow, and Python to automate healthcare data ingestion and reporting.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interests lie in data engineering, analytics, and machine learning â€” using modern cloud platforms to drive reliable, actionable insights from data.
